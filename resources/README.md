# HW 8 Controller:
###In homework 8, we created a new playback view as well as created a controller that abstracted out the code from our previous main method. This allows us to have a cleaner design and implementation. The controller handles all the inputs / output from the model that is built by the AnimationReader and output that is genereated by the differrent Views. We added butons the playback view that allow a use to stop/start the animation that is happening, we added a rewind button that will rewind the animation back to the beginning, we added a loop checkbox that will loop the animation once it stops, and lastly we added a set speed input where the user can increase the speed of the animation dynamically.
